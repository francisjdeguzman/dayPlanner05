# dayPlanner05

As an employee with a busy schedule, planning out my days is crucial to my productivity, flow of work and efficiency.


- The application displays the times of day during a normal work day (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).

- Each timeblock contains an input field and save button.

- Clicking the "save" button stores the input locally and allows the user to refresh the page and still have what he/she has inputted.

- Current date displayed at the top and center of the page.

- The past, present and future are all color coded to eliminate the chance of confusion.
